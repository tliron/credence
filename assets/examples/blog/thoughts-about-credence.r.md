Thoughts About Credence
=======================

I like [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

But it's cool that Credence supports GitHub-Flavored Markdown, so that I can include amazing tables like this:

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
