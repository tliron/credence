# This configuration file simply spells out all the defaults.
# You can use it for reference or copy and modify it as needed.

# * All paths can be absolute *or* relative to the directory where *this* file is located
# * Time duration syntax: https://docs.rs/parse_duration/latest/parse_duration/#syntax
# * Byte size syntax supports metric units (mb, kb, gb, etc.) and binary (mib, kib, gib, etc.)
#   (as well as fractions, such as "1.5 gib")

# This area is ignored by Credence
# Use it for your own purposes, e.g. for YAML anchors, for example:
#definitions:
#  values: &values
#    a: b

files:
  # Change path to assets directory.
  #assets: /my/web/site

  # Path to directory where Credence will look for custom error pages
  # e.g. `status/404.html`
  status: status

  # Path to directory where Credence will look for Jinja templates
  # e.g. `templates/default.jinja`
  templates: templates

  # Enable file modification coordinator
  coordinate:
    # Paths to watch for modifications (directories are scanned recursively)
    paths:
    - templates

    # Path to coordinator file
    coordinator: .coordinator

    # Whether to follow symlinks in paths
    follow-symlinks: true

    # Whether to fully compare contents (using a hash) to determine if files have changed
    # (Otherwise uses modification timestamp)
    # Enable this when using filesystems that do not report reliable modification timestamps
    compare-contents: false

    # How many modification messages to allow in queue
    queue-size: 128


# You can define one or more ports that Credence will listen to
# If not specified will default to a single 8000 port as shown here
ports:
  # Map from TCP port
  8000:
    # `name` is optional and only used for debugging
    name: http

    # `address` can be:
    # * A specific IPv6 or IPv4 address,
    # * The non-specific IPv6 ("::") or non-specific IPv4 ("0.0.0.0"),
    #   which will enable a heuristic to enumerate all the "reachable" addresses of that IP version
    # * Empty (the default), which will enumerate all "reachable" addresses of *both* IP versions
    #   (a.k.a. "dual stack")
    #address: "::"

    # Optional IPv6 zone, either network interface name or its 0-based index
    # (only used for a specific IPv6 address)
    #zone: enp6s0

    # Optional IPv6 flowinfo
    # (only used for a specific IPv6 address)
    #flowinfo: 0

    # Whether to include loopbacks when enumerating "reachable" addresses
    include-loopbacks: true

    # Optional host names to support on the port
    # The host name is sent by the client (normally as part of the URL)
    # When specified, *only* these hosts will be allowed
    # When not specified (the default) Credence will not check the host name

    # Without TLS, just use a string
    # Example:

    #hosts:
    #- localhost
    #- mainsite.org

    # To redirect all requests for this host to another port use the following longer notation
    # This is useful, for example, for redirecting all "http:" URLs to "https:"
    # You will get a configuration error if the port is not defined
    #- name: mainsite.org
    #  redirect-to: 443

    # To enable TLS ("https") on the port (usually 443) use the following longer notation
    # Note that a single listener cannot mix both TLS and non-TLS hosts

    # Provide certificates (can be a chain) and a private key in PEM format
    # Use a string or (`{content: ...}`) to embed the PEM text directly here
    # Or use `{path: ...}` to a PEM file (as in this example)
    # Example:

    #hosts:
    #- host: mainsite.org
    #  key:
    #    certificates: { path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/mainsite.org/fullchain.pem }
    #    private-key: { path: /etc/letsencrypt/live/mainsite.org/privkey.pem }
    #- host: secondsite.org
    #  key:
    #    certificates: { path: keys/secondsite.org/certificates.pem }
    #    private-key: { path: keys/secondsite.org/private-key.pem }
